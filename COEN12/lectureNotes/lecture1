    Data Structure
    Code efficiency

Big-O

Mesaure efficiency 
    Count the number of operations

Big-O Notation
    classify the cost of an algorithm

    To compute runtime
        drop all but the fastest-growing term
        drop any coefficient on that remaining term

        e.g. 3n+2 is O(n)
